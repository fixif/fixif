	of recursive or IIR digital filters are highly sensitive to the
	coefficient quantization and have large roundoff noise. As the sampling
	rate is increased the poles approachz = 1and the problems become
	more severe. For these situations several new digital filter structures
	are presented for which the above errors remain constant and generally
	insignificant as the sampling rate is increased. Results on sensitivity
	and the roundoff errors for these new structures are presented and
	compared with conventional realizations. Some numerical results

	regard to implementation, they occupy the same position of importance
	that causal systems occupy in the 1-D case. A framework for the
	characterization and structural description of recursible systems
	is presented. Included in this description are a theorem characterizing
	recursible systems and recursible multidimensional difference equations,
	a generalized signal flow graph formalism, a new state-space model,
	and an extended state-space representation which allows algorithms
	not describable by a state-space model to be described by a state-space-like
	framework. Examples are given to illustrate each of these concepts.},

	The other is the statistical approach, where the errors of coefficient
	quantization are assumed to be independent random variables. The
	statistical approach gives a simple and easy way to analyze the
	output error variance due to coefficient quantization of state-space
	digital filters. The statistical coefficient sensitivity introduced
	by the statistical approach is shown to be equivalent to the round
	off noise power gain. Thus, state-space digital filters which are
	optimal with respect to both coefficient sensitivity and roundoff
	noise can be synthesized by the method of minimization of the roundoff
	noise. Such optimal state-space digital filters which could be of
	any order are proved to be free of autonomous overflow limit cycles.
	A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of
	the analysis of the output error variance due to coefficient quantization
	and the synthesis method proposed here.},

	be represented by a "stray" transfer function in parallel with the
	corresponding ideal filter. Also, by making certain statistical
	assumptions, the statistically expected mean-square difference between
	the real frequency responses of the actual and ideal filters can
	be readily evaluated by one short computer program for all widths
	of quantization. Furthermore, the same computations may be used
	to evaluate the rms value of output noise due to data quantization
	and multiplicative rounding errors. Experimental measurements verify
	the analysis in a practical case. The application of the results
	to the design of the digital filters is also considered.},

  abstract = {Roundoff noise (RN) is known to exist in digital filters and systems
	under finite-precision operations and can become a critical factor
	for severe performance degradation in infinite impulse response
	(IIR) filters and systems. In the literature, two classes of methods
	are available for RN reduction or minimization-one uses state-space
	coordinate transformation, the other uses error feedback/feed-forward
	of state variables. In this paper, we propose a method for the joint
	optimization of error feedback/feed-forward and state-space realization.
	It is shown that the problem at hand can be solved in an unconstrained
	optimization setting. With a closed-form formula for gradient evaluation
	and an efficient quasi-Newton solver, the unconstrained minimization
	problem can be solved efficiently. With the infinite-precision solution
	as a reference point, we then move on to derive a semidefinite programming
	(SDP) relaxation method for an approximate solution of optimal error-feedback
	matrix with sum-of-power-of-two entries under a given state-space
	realization. Simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed
	algorithms and demonstrate the performance of optimized systems.},

  abstract = {Beginning with an external specification of a digital filter, structures
	which minimize roundoff noise are investigated. After fixing the
	probability of overflow through anl_{2}scaling procedure, roundoff
	noise is studied via the internal structure of the filter using
	a state variable formulation. An output noise variance formula in
	terms of the internal structure is derived. Conditions for minimizing
	this output noise are established and realizations which meet these
	conditions are constructed. A new set of filter invariants called
	second-order modes are defined and shown to play a definitive role
	in minimal noise realizations. From these invariants, for example,
	one can calculate the minimal output noise variance of a given external
	specification. Numerical results are given which compare these new
	filter structures with the usual parallel and cascade connections
	of second-order filters, both theoretically and through simulations.
	For narrow-band filters, these new structures can be orders of magnitude
	better (in terms of output noise variance). One drawback of these
	new structures is a large increase in the number of multipliers
	needed to realize them. However, by applying the theory to subfilters
	connected in parallel and cascade, a good compromise between output
	noise and number of multipliers is obtained.}

  abstract = {When digital signal processing operations are implemented on a computer
	or with special-purpose hardware, errors and constraints due to
	finite word length are unavoidable. The main categories of finite
	register length effects are errors due to A/D conversion, errors
	due to roundoffs in the arithmetic, constraints on signal levels
	imposed by the need to prevent overflow, and quantization of system
	coefficients. The effects of finite register length on implementations
	of linear recursive difference equation digital filters, and the
	fast Fourier transform (FFT), are discussed in some detail. For
	these algorithms, the differing quantization effects of fixed point,
	floating point, and block floating point arithmetic are examined
	and compared. The paper is intended primarily as a tutorial review
	of a subject which has received considerable attention over the
	past few years. The groundwork is set through a discussion of the
	relationship between the binary representation of numbers and truncation
	or rounding, and a formulation of a statistical model for arithmetic
	roundoff. The analyses presented here are intended to illustrate
	techniques of working with particular models. Results of previous
	work are discussed and summarized when appropriate. Some examples
	are presented to indicate how the results developed for simple digital
	filters and the FFT can be applied to the analysis of more complicated
	systems which use these algorithms as building blocks.},

	The system studied utilizes stellar-referenced angle sightings to a sequence
	of known terrestrial landmarks.	A Kalman filter is used to compute differential corrections to spacecraft
	position,	spacecraft velocity, and landmark location. A variety of filter modifications
	for the control	of divergence was investigated. These included the Schmidt-Pines analytical
	modification	and an empirical modification based upon Pines machine noise treatment.
	Several	simplified approximations to the theoretically optimum analytical
	modifications were also	investigated. The principal numerical results are presented in graphs
	of the magnitude of	the error in estimated position and velocity vs time for sixteen orbits.
	These graphs compare	actual position and velocity errors with the theoretical estimates
	furnished by the trace of the	position and velocity covariance matrices. Numerical results indicate
	that a properly modified filter achieves a steady-state operating level.},
